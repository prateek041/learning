# What I want to do with my life

This is all about setting priorities

In the next 3 months I see myself working extensively working with an international company doing things that matter

## Technologies I want to work with:

- Go
- Kubernetes

I think the biggest thing I want is to find a great mentor, where I am learning new things everyday, from an expert in the field. But before that, let's see what I want to do with my life. what I think about my own life.

# What I want

## 10 years from now

I am happy, with a family that loves me, a family that I can provide for, people respecting me, a good number of friends, being known for some amazing contributions to the society, being a tycoon in the industry. A great business so that I don't even think about money.

## What makes me happy?

I think the biggest happiness is being able to do what I want to, being looked at as an idol, traveling the world and having a bunch of friends.

I personally don't like being desciplined, but maybe because I have never been desciplined for a long period in my entire life, and I need to actually go to the end, to judge if I like it or not.

## 5 years from now

A successful person, with amazing physique, network, respect in the society, engineering skills, leader in the society regarding something, not scared, loved by people, in a great company with great engineers and insanely good at something engineering related and a strong individual.

later on I will write an extensive plan of how I think I can achieve what I want to achieve.

## 2 months from now

A great company, with an expert in a domain as my mentor, a high paying job so I can leave house and travel world, live anywhere in India and be able to support my needs and my family's needs, with people who care.100 kg bodyweight. calm, and supporting family.

# How do I get it?

## 2 months plan

First thing is, I need to be desciplined, very desciplined, It doesn't matter if I have the best plan, if I don't stick to it, I cannot be good enough for anything I want in my life, so yes, time to win

### A great company

A great company is a place, where I matter, where I work on things that I believe are worth spending my time on. where I work with people who themselves are leader in the domains, where people look upto us.

### Experts in domain

They are niche and great companies, don't be a part of a venture lab, where you are just a cheap work labour for doing something that a lot of people are already doing. domain experts are in great companies, where there are less people, doing more and niche. Avoid crowd.

### A hight paying job

If a company is great and has domain experts working on things, it will have high paying salaries as well. Still let's talk numbers, I want to be paid $100k yearly. I don't know how, but I will brainstorm how and get to it, but I want that.

### traveling

For this, I just need a high paying job, because I am not scared to travel, even alone, all I lack is money, I need that certain amount of money that I think I need to travel, even though it is all just in my head, it is what it is and I am just a human as well. But this is what I decide I will go ahead with.

### Family needs

I need to be a more calm person, a person who understands what others are going through and be the bigger one in the room, but only for people he loves nothing other than that. I don't want to be angry at my family, do what they want me to do, accept my faults and work on it to improve them.

### 100 Kg bodyweight

This means tracking calories everyday, be in a calorie deficit and loose around 5 kg per month which is actually a healthy weight loss target. Hit the gym 5 days a week, keep a journal of what are your current PRs and and how you are improving everyday. Eventually all of this will be concluded and become more concentrated

So finally, what's the plan, that if I follow it everyday, I will be where I want to be?
