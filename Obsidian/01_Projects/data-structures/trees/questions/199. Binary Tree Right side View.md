```python
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(root)
        result = []
        while q:
            iteration_length = len(q)
            altered = False
            for i in range (iteration_length):
                item = q.popleft()
                if item:
                    if not altered:
                        result.append(item.val)
                        altered = True
                    q.append(item.right)
                    q.append(item.left)
            
        return result
```

The approach is straightforward
- perform BFS (Right side level order traversal)
- At every level you are supposed to push only 1 element into the result array
- Start popping from left and keep track if you pushed in the result already.
- Push the children of every node regardless.

> [!important] 
> Push a node value in the result only when you haven't pushed anything in the node for the level yet, along with the node not being null
