## Twenty second Video (Capstone Project)

### Project

Distributed Task Queue System.

This is going to be a multi video project, that is going to help people to build production grade projects and deploy it on Kubernetes.

Introduction of the Big Project we are going to make.

- What we will learn after building it.
  - Network Programming concepts
  - Setting up a TCP server/client connection using HTTP. (maybe gRPC).
  - Advanced concurrency patterns (worker pools, rate limitations).
  - Implementing a message broker (using Kafka, rabbitMQ).
  - Error recovery and resiliencyy patterns.
  - Benchmarking and unit testing.
  - Profiling and performance optimisation.
  - Dependency injection.

## list of videos

- These will be the projects that will build the project step by step, implementing things layer by layer.

I need to plan it more, beceause I would have to build thid project myself first :D.

## Expert (Capstone Project )

### Project

Microservice Architecture application.

- Designing the architecture.
- Inter service communication via REST (maybe gRPC.)
- service discover and loadbalancing using API Gateway.
- Auth
- Logging, Tracing, Metrics using Prometheus.
- Visualization using Grafana Dashboards.
- CI/CD setup using Github Actions.
