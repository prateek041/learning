- Error handling in React
- Prop drilling (passing props through component hierarchy)
- Basic component lifecycle

### 3. **Movie Search App**

**Things you will learn:**

- Debouncing user input (search queries)
- Handling and displaying dynamic data from API responses
- Advanced list rendering with unique keys
- Managing complex state and effects
- Introduction to context API for state management

### 4. **Blog Platform**

**Things you will learn:**

- CRUD operations with a backend API
- React Router for client-side routing
- Nested routes and dynamic routes
- Forms and form validation
- Lifting state up to manage form inputs and submissions
- Using external libraries for rich text editing (e.g., Draft.js or Quill)

### 5. **E-commerce Store**

**Things you will learn:**

- Advanced state management with Context API and `useReducer`
- Product listing, filtering, and sorting
- Shopping cart functionality
- User authentication (sign up, login, logout) using JWT or Firebase
- Protected routes and role-based access control
- Payment integration (e.g., Stripe)

### 6. **Chat Application**

**Things you will learn:**

- WebSocket or Firebase for real-time communication
- Managing real-time data and updates in React
- Building a chat UI with message threads and user interactions
- Notifications and alerts
- Optimizing performance for real-time applications

### 7. **Project Management Tool**

**Things you will learn:**

- Drag and drop functionality (using libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd`)
- Advanced form handling and complex state management
- Integrating with third-party services (e.g., Trello API)
- Managing user permissions and collaborative features
- Creating a responsive and dynamic UI with complex state transitions

### 8. **Social Media Platform**

**Things you will learn:**

- Building a large-scale application with multiple modules (feed, profiles, notifications)
- Infinite scrolling and pagination
- Advanced user authentication and profile management
- Integrating with GraphQL for API interactions
- Building a robust backend (if full-stack) with Node.js/Express or using services like Firebase/Firestore

### 9. **Portfolio Website with CMS**

**Things you will learn:**

- Integrating with a headless CMS (like Contentful or Strapi)
- Static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js
- SEO optimization techniques in React
- Advanced routing and dynamic page creation
- Deploying React applications to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS

### 10. **Code Editor**

**Things you will learn:**

- Building a complex UI with CodeMirror or Monaco Editor
- Syntax highlighting and code parsing
- File system simulation in the browser
- State synchronization and data persistence (local storage or backend)
- Creating plugins or extensions for the editor

### Additional Learning Resources and Practices:

- **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests to your projects using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learn about React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and performance profiling tools.
- **TypeScript**: Start integrating TypeScript into your React projects for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure your applications are accessible by following WAI-ARIA guidelines and using tools like `react-aria`.

By following this incremental approach, you will progressively build up your skills and understanding of React, covering both fundamental and advanced concepts through practical application. Happy coding!
